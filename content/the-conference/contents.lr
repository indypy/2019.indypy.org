PyCascades is a two-day Python conference that will be held March 2019 in the
scenic coastal city of Seattle, Washington (USA).

Organized by members of the Python communities in Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland, we aim to bring together Python users and developers from both the Pacific Northwest and around the world.
