title: Code of Conduct

---

body:

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact the IndyPy Organizers by e-mailing ​[info@indypy.com](mailto:info@indypy.com).**

IndyPy is a community intended for networking and collaboration in the Python community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an
enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy
to other attendees at the monthly meetups, conferences, and online spaces (such as Slack), whether officially
sponsored by IndyPy or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any
IndyPy event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout
the event.

##THE SHORT VERSION

IndyPy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion or political affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for IndyPy. Attendees violating these rules may be asked
to leave without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

##THE LONGER VERSION

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive
to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for IndyPy.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the IndyPy organizers may take any action
they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

#A member of the Python community is:

##Open
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. We're
receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to
the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

##Considerate
Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users. We're thoughtful when addressing the
efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

##Respectful
Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments,
and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're respectful of
the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising
our issues.

Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to.
If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.
