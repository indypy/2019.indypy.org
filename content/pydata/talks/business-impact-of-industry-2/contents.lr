abstract:
As firms embark on their digital journeys amidst a rapidly evolving and complex environment, theyâ€™ll need to remember that execution is key to success. To effectively do so, firms need to properly assess their digital maturity or readiness; articulate the problem to solve and the corresponding benefits; define and prioritize best-fit Industry 4.0 opportunities; develop a plan that incorporates not only the technology but addresses the change management associated with the people and processes to ensure sustainable adoption; and masterfully execute the plan as quickly as possible to maintain or gain a sustainable competitive advantage. The presentation will provide key success attributes as well as a high-level roadmap to achieve digital success with an emphasis on execution in supply chain-intensive firms like manufacturers. The presentation will also provide an overview of various Industry 4.0 technology and offer a live demonstration of a small scale unique Industry 4.0 application.
