bio:
Currently, work in the operations department of the Army Medical Department focused on improving operational efficiencies, marketing spends and retention of our workforce. Previousely I was a Reconisince Specialist deployed to various war zones around the world. During that time I gained a love and appreciation for how data and artificial intelligence can help solve complex problems. I enjoy working with text and image data to better understand how computers can leverage large amounts of data and compute to provide meaningful insights at scale.
