We are very excited to share with all of you the incredible speakers for PyCascades 2019. We received over 230 talk proposals, which we had to narrow down to just 20. As you can imagine, not an easy task for our program committee. But their dedication produced what we think will be an outstanding program.

Weâ€™d like to extend a big "Thank You" to everyone who submitted a proposal. Your time and effort make it possible for us to put together a conference that people donâ€™t want to miss.

And weâ€™d like to extend our gratitude to our hardworking program chair Georgia Reh and all the reviewers who made this announcement possible in the first place.
