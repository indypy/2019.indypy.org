title: The Amazing Mutable, Immutable Tuple and Other Philosophic Digressions
---
audience_level: Intermediate
---
abstract: Everyone knows Python tuples are immutable, but an immutable tuple that contains mutable objects is itself mutable. Or is it? What is immutability? Or equality? What is "is"? And what does Humpty Dumpty have to say about it? In this talk, we examine what these terms mean in far too much fun detail.
