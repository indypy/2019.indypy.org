Please self-select the appropriate registration group:

* `Corporate registration <https://ti.to/pycascades/pycascades-2019/with/oa9o1q4hzkg>`__. If you work for a company that is paying for your attendance to PyCascades, we ask that you register at the corporate rate. You will help keep the conference affordable for everyone, especially students and those needing financial aid. Government employees should also register at the corporate rate.
* `Individual registration <https://ti.to/pycascades/pycascades-2019/with/jshmywd4wly>`__. If you are paying your own way to PyCascades and are not a student, please register as an individual. Employees of non-profits might also choose to register at the individual rate.
