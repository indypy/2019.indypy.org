Yes, it's that exciting time of year again when we all get together and kick
off the second ever PyCascades 🎉. 

This year, we'll be put on a great show for you in the wonderful city of
Seattle, WA 🇺🇸. And to make you not dread the weather as much, we've decided to
go for a springtime conference in early March (we'll confirm the date soon.)

And with our 2019 location comes a whole new team of chairs. We are all super
excited to announce **Alan Vezina** and **Thea Flowers** running the show this
year 🤩. You can check out our `organizers </organizers>`_ page or 👋🏼 at them `on
Slack <http://bit.ly/pycascades-slack>`_.

We'll need some `amazing sponsors </sponsors>`_ to make all of this possible.
Talk to us if you are interested in being a supporter.

Make sure to `subscribe to our newsletter </#newsletter>`_ to be the first to
hear about the confirmed dates, our call for talk submissions and more.

Talk to y'all soon as the planning unravels 👋🏼.
