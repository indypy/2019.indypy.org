# Website for PyCascades

Just a few notes on how to work with this setup for the website. The most
important is that we are using the static site generator
[Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) and are hosting the content on
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/2019-pycascades).

## Why Lektor?

Lektor is a static site generator written in Python. The reason for choosing it
(and if you need somebody to blame...it was Seb) was that it provides a much
easier way to:

1. Customize the website templates without having to build a full themes.
2. Create simple and flexible data representations for different parts of the site.

Basically, Lektor has a file-based data model that allows custom objects to be
defined such as *sponsors*, *organizers* and others.

The best way to understand how Lektor works it to take a look [at the content
model in the docs](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/content/) and through the code
here.


## Running Lektor locally

Let's get you started with downloading the latest version of the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:pycascades/www.pycascades.com.git
$ cd www.pycascades.com
```

Lektor needs Python (I think we all do ğŸ˜‰). This means you'll have to setup a
virtualenv before you can install it:

```
$ pipenv --three
$ pipenv shell
```

Now you're ready to get things installed:

```
$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

And with Lektor finally installed, you can run the built-in development server:

```
$ lektor server
```

You should be able to view the site by heading to
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).


## Changes to CSS / Javascript

We are using a hand-rolled extension for Lektor that uses the `webassets` package
to build CSS and Javascript artefacts. This might have some bugs in it still.

If you make changes to a CSS or Javascript file and changes aren't reflected in
the dev server. You should clear the built cache and start the service again:

```
$ lektor clean -yes && lektor server
```

Also let Seb know that he needs to fix this ğŸ˜‡.


## Deploying the site to Netlify

Our Netlify setup is integrated with Github. That means **all branches** that
are pushed to Github will be built on Netlify and will be available on a unique
URL. If you need access to the Netlify account, ask Seb.

The `master` branch is the Production branch. 

> At this point, we are not automatically deploying from `master` to the live
> site. A deploy will be created and viewable but it has to be set as the
> live deploy manually
> [in Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/2019-pycascades/deploys).
